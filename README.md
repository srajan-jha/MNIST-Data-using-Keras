## About the Dataset

MNIST dataset is one of the classical problem in machine learning which deals to tackle the problem of recognizing hand-writeen digits from 0 through 9. It is often referred to as the 'Hello World Program'  for Machine Learning!

The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of digits each being 28 x 28 pixels in size.


We'll be traning a basic neural network to deal with the problem statement using Keras framework. It is a simple yet elegant, pseudocode-based framework which is used over Tensorflow and you'll get to learn about it as you'll move forward here. so let us get going!
